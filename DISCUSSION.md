Some additional improvements I would like to add:

- Adding a table skeleton when loading for the first time
- Adding indexes for frequently searched columns
- Possibly using a cursor with a stable field like createdAt instead of using limit/offset
- Possibly implement infinite scrolling instead of manual pagination clicking
